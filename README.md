# binary_tree_constructor
A constructor to build a binary tree by in-order and pre-order.

Use in-order and pre-order to build a binary tree is a medium level
Leetcode problem. I thought it is useful to build a tool that can
construct a binary tree so I can explorer more about binary tree.

If you want to use it, clone with submodule and use cmake.

```bash
git clone --recursive git@github.com:zanets/binary_tree_constructor.git
cd binary_tree_constructor
cmake .
make
```
